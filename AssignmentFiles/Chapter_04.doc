1. Is JSX mandatory for REact?
nope. KSX is not mandatory for react. JSX gives more readable way for react. 
JSX internally uses react.createlement and return react object

2.is ES6 mandatory for react?
ES6 is js standarization to mek code more readable ans more accessible. it is not mandatory for react. that is 
instead ES6 map(), we can still use foreach with more code and logic to achive same as map().

3.In JSX {TitleComp}, <TitleComp/> amd <TitleComp></TitleComp> are the diffremt way to access React Functional component

4. Comments in JSX: same as JS comment . // single line or /**/ multiline 

5.<REact.Fragment></REact.Fragment> : Is a functional component in react from React library.
 It is used to have empty tag around mutiple Func. component as JSX can have only one parent element.

 <></> is the short way to write above code.

 6.Virtual DOM: It is a programming concept. it a representation of DOM in memory and sync it with actual DOM. 
 used by react library to render its component in UI. This process is called Reconciliation

 7.Reconciliation : 
 On eveytime render() is called, react render /update only the changed the component, element or attributes.This process is called
 Reconciliation. React uses Diff algorithm to determine the changes and render the UI accordingly .
 Diffing two tress.

 This is an algorithm that react uses to diff one tree with another to determine which part need to be chnaged

 8.REact fiber: It is new React Reconciliation engine .

 9.Need of key: Key should be unique . React uses diff algorithm to dtermine the changes and update/ render the UI. Key helps the React 
 to render only changed element not entire UI

 10. Index should not be recommoned as key. But Index is better for no key. and unique key best for Index key

 11: Props: Props are property passed as a parameter to Functional or Class comment. This props can have any value.T
 there are different ways this props can be destructured and used. One such way is pass value/pbject using js ... spread operator 

 12.Config driven uI is the design pattern, where UI render will depend on configuration send from APIs. Eg, show offers, discount based on location
 in the websites.
